# Abstract
Industry 4.0 technologies represent high-level intelligent manufacturing strategies that increase production efficiency and decrease production time. For an instance, one of the most useful Material Handling System (MHS) is Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS), which allows factory owners to enhance operational efficiency and increase productivity. The main aim of this study is to create a simulation platform of a MHS serviced by Rail Guided Vehicles (RGV) to measure possible performance improvements on the MHS. MHS serviced by RGV, which we used in this study, is in the class of Discrete Event Systems (DES). One of the most commonly used method in modeling and analysis of the DES is Petri nets. Petri nets are very efficient for modeling the MHS’s dynamic behaviors, especially convenient for real time control implementation. In this study, Petri nets are used for modeling framework. The model is constructed and implemented in MATLAB’s Simulink Stateflow environment. An interface is designed in MATLAB’s GUI tool for setting system’s specific parameters, choosing the type of input load, demonstrating the performance graphs, monitoring the system online and real-time controlling. The RGV’s route is divided into 2 zone with an interlocking application for reducing unnecessary movements after the simulation of system was completed and these changes were implemented on the simulation. Finally, the performance of the system for with/without interlocking application are compared with each other according to the performance indices in literature under three different type load inputs which are low, medium and high frequency.
